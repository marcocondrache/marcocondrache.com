          I work as a software engineer for <em>Danfoss</em> in Italy. My
          passion for learning and self-improvement drives my professional
          growth and innovation in the field.

          Currently, I&apos;m immersing myself in <em>TypeScript</em> and{" "}
          <em>Rust</em>, aiming to push the boundaries of web development by
          creating high-performance, engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to growth is hands-on: I learn through active{" "}
          <em>building</em> and&nbsp;
          <em>experimentation</em>, constantly refining my skills in the
          process.
