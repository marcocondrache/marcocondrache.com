Inspired by this <a href="https://x.com/KumailNanji/status/1817901890035716198" target="_blank">post</a> on X, this creative navbar uses Framer Motion for smooth size and shape transitions, triggered by user interactions.

SVG filters create a distinctive gooey effect [^1], giving the navbar a fluid, blob-like appearance as it morphs. The result is a visually striking and interactive UI element that enhances the user experience through its dynamic transformations.
